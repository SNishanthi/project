<h3><b><u>Blackwell's Family</u></b></h3>
Blackwell was the third of nine children of Hannah Lane and Samuel Blackwell, a sugar refiner, Quaker, and anti-slavery activist. In 1832, the Blackwell family moved to America, settling in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1838, Samuel Blackwell died, leaving the family penniless during a national financial crisis. </p>

<h3><b><u>Beginning of journey</u></b></h3>
Blackwell was inspired to pursue medicine by a dying friend who said her ordeal would have been better had she had a female physician. There were few medical colleges and none that accepted women.Elizabeth, her mother, and two older sisters worked in the predominantly female profession of teaching. While teaching, Blackwell boarded with the families of two southern physicians who mentored her. </p>

<h3><b><u>Her Rejection period</u></b></h3>
In 1847, she returned to Philadelphia, hoping that Quaker friends could assist her entrance into medical school. Rejected everywhere she applied, she was ultimately admitted to Geneva College in rural New York. Blackwell faced discrimination and obstacles in college: professors forced her to sit separately at lectures and often excluded her from labs. </p>

Blackwell eventually earned the respect of professors and classmates, graduating first in her class in 1849. She continued her training at London and Paris hospitals .
